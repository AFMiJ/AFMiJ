 **_NOTE: on MacOS downloading and unzipping the folder will result in a quarantined (and then blocked) app._**
   To avoid this, use one of the following strategies:
   
-	after unzipping, open a terminal window, cd to the folder containing the app (AFMiJ.OSX.app), then issue the following command:  
	xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine AFMiJ.OSX.app 
- or unzip with 7zip
- or download and unzip on another operating system, then copy the folder to the MacOS system

<!--
**AFMiJ/AFMiJ** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
